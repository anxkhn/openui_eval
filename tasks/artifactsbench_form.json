Check if the visualization uses appropriate Fyne canvas elements (Rectangle, Circle, Text) or custom rendering. Deduct 5 points if the shape is too simplistic, 3 points if proper scaling is missing, and 5 points if the traditional gold color scheme (golden yellow with appropriate shading) is absent. The full score is 10 points.",

Check if responsive design principles are applied to handle window resizing. Deduct 5 points if fixed positioning is used instead of layouts, 3 points if elements overlap incorrectly, and 5 points if the layout doesn't adapt to different screen sizes.

Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
