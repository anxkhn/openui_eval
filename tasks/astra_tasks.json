    "prompt": "Overview In this task , the goal is to build a simple cyclic counter component . The component must be rendered as <button> with text content corresponding to the current count . Initially , the count is always 0. The component receives a prop cycle defining the counting cycle . After the component is clicked with the mouse , the count value is incremented by one , and if it reaches the value cycle , it is reset to 0 instead . Please see the below animation to see how this is supposed to work when the given cycle value is 4. User Interface Elements The project is initially filled with boilerplate code with the following elements in the interface . Their properties and behavior must be defined as given . Each of these elements must have the given data-testid property , which will be used while testing the solution . The <button> rendered by CycleCount component: - data-testid : cycle-counter - initial text content: 0 Expected Behavior Clicking on <button> rendered by the CycleCount component must result in the appropriate user interface changes: - If the text content of <button> before the click was integer k , then it is updated to k + 1, unless k + 1 = cycle , in which case , it is reset to 0 instead .\n\nFramework: React\nTask Type: Frontend Development\nDifficulty: medium\n\nRequirements:\n1.

    "prompt": "Overview In this task , the goal is to create a simple application using the JavaScript Fetch API to fetch a paginated list of articles and render their titles on a selected page in an unordered list . User Interface Elements Your task is to complete the implementation of src/components/Articles . js . The file is initially filled with boilerplate code with the following elements in the interface . Their properties and behavior must be defined asgiven . Pay attention to the provided data-testid property , which will be used while testing the solution . Expected Behavior On the app load , the application must use JavaScript Fetch API , specifically the fetch function , to perform a GET request to https://jsonmock . hackerrank . com/api/articles ? page=1 . The response will contain a totalpages field that denotes the number of pages of results available , and a data field that is an array of articles on the requested page . You must render as many page buttons as there are number of pages , where each button must contain a text content equal to the page number it corresponds to , from 1 to totalpages . Each button must be rendered as the element <button data-testid=\"\"page-button\"\">{k}</button> , where {k} is the number of pages the button corresponds to . Each of the articles will contain a title field , and your task is to retrieve all the articles from the response that have a not-null title and are non-empty (i . e ., different from the empty string) and display them as elements <li data-testid=\"\"result-row\"\">{title}</li> , where {title} is the title of an article , in the order they appear in the data field . Clicking on a page button corresponding to a page with some number (for instance , number 3) must result in using the fetch function to perform a GET request to https://jsonmock . hackerrank . com/api/articles ? page=3 and display the returned articles in the same manner as described above . In other words , clicking on a page number button must cause the rendering of the articles on that page of the results .\n\nFramework: React\nTask Type: Frontend Development\nDifficulty: medium\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The steps and timers are two different arrays , but they are interpreted in combination with each other . The time required to finish step 1 (index 0) of the steps array is stored in the 0th index of the timer array . { \"\"id\"\": 2, \"\"name\"\": \"\"Roasted Asparagus\"\", \"\"steps\"\": [ \"\"Preheat oven to 425F .\"\", \"\"Cut off the woody bottom part of the asparagus spears and discard .\"\", \"\"With a vegetable peeler , peel off the skin on the bottom 2-3 inches of the spears (this keeps the asparagus from being all and if you eat asparagus you know what I mean by that).\"\", \"\"Place asparagus on foil-lined baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil .\"\", \"\"Sprinkle with salt .\"\", \"\"With your hands , roll the asparagus around until they are evenly coated with oil and salt .\"\", \"\"Roast for 10-15 minutes , depending on the thickness of your stalks and how tender you like them .\"\", \"\"They should be tender when pierced with the tip of a knife .\"\", \"\"The tips of the spears will get very brown but watch them to prevent burning .\"\", \"\"They are great plain , but sometimes I serve them with a light vinaigrette if we need something acidic to balance out our meal .\"\" ], \"\"timers\"\": [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0 ] }, Routes /recipes/step/:id ? elapsedTime - The id parameter should be used to filter the results based on the ID of the object provided . If the ID is not valid or is not a valid number , the server should send a status code 400 with 'NOTFOUND' in the body of the response . Examples /recipes/step/4? elapsedTime=11 Outptut - {index: 0} Explanation - The ID of the recipe in the URL is 4. The recipe with ID 4 has the following properties: { \"\"id\"\": 4, \"\"name\"\": \"\"Big Night Pizza\"\", \"\"steps\"\": [ \"\"Add hot water to yeast in a large bowl and let sit for 15 minutes .\"\", \"\"Mix in oil , sugar , salt , and flour and let sit for 1 hour .\"\", ... ], \"\"timers\"\": [ 15, 60, ... ] } The elapsed time sent as query param is 11. This roughly translates to , \"\"Which step will be active for this recipe when 11 minutes have passed after starting the recipe ?\"\" The step at index 0 has a timer property of 15. So after 11 minutes , step 1 will be the current step , and its index is 0, which is the final output . /recipes/step/wqw Status Code - 400 Body - NOTFOUND\n\nFramework: Next.js\nTask Type: Full Stack Development\nDifficulty: hard\n\nRequirements:\n1.

    "prompt": "An eCommerce company is growing rapidly , and stock management is becoming a bottleneck . As the NodeJS developer in the company , you have been given the task to write an Order-Processing Script that takes the order data as input , performs a few pre-order checks/validations , and returns the result . If any line-itemin the order data does not pass the pre-order checks , the order should fail , and the corresponding failure event should be fired . Class Description Create a module , processor . js , and implement the following set of functionalities: The file should export a class OrderProcessor as the default export of the module , and it should inherit from the EventEmitter class . The class should have the following methods: placeOrder :Accepts the order data as an argument and immediately starts performing the validations on it . The orderData passed to the function should have the following properties/shape: [ { \"\"orderNumber\"\": \"\"OD2323\"\", // Order Number of the order \"\"lineItems\"\": [ // Array containing the lineItems in the order { \"\"itemId\"\": 3, // ID of the line Item . \"\"quantity\"\": 4 // The quantity requested in the order }, { \"\"itemId\"\": 5, \"\"quantity\"\": 4 } ] } ] The class should emit the following events: PROCESSINGSTARTED: Should be fired just before the validations are started for an order . The order number of the current order should be passed to the callback of the event handler . PROCESSINGFAILED: Should be fired if , for any reason , the pre-order checksdonot pass . The callback of the event handlerwill accept an object containing the following properties: orderNumber: The orderNumber of the order that failed to process . itemId: The ID of the first matching item that failed to process . reason: The reason why the processing failed . It can be one of INSUFFICIENTSTOCK orLINEITEMSEMPTY . If the lineItems property is a blank array , the check should fail with the reasonLINEITEMSEMPTY . The itemId property need not be passed to the errorObject in this scenario . If any of the lineItems ' requested quantity is more than the matching stock property in the stockData array , the check should fail with the reasonINSUFFICIENTSTOCK . PROCESSINGSUCCESS: Should be fired if all the pre-order checkspass . The order number of the current order should be passed to the callback of the event handler . The file containing the current stock information , stock-list . json , is added to the root of the project and can be used for validation . An explanation of an entry in the JSON array is as follows: id : The IDof the item for which stock information is stored . stock : The current stock count of the item . [ { \"\"id\"\": 0, \"\"stock\"\": 4 }, { \"\"id\"\": 1, \"\"stock\"\": 12 }, ... ] Note: It can be assumed that lineitems passed to the placeOrder function will always be an array , and the ID of the lineItem passed will always be present in the stock list . No extra code is required for these conditions . Example Implementation const OrderProcessor = require('./order-processor'); const orderProcessor = new OrderProcessor(); orderProcessor . on('PROCESSINGSTARTED', (orderNumber) => { console . log(Pre Order Checks Running for {orderNumber}) }); orderProcessor . on('PROCESSINGFAILED', (failureData) => { console . log(Failed Order); console . log(- OrderNumber: {failureData . orderNumber}); console . log(- Reason: {failureData . reason}); console . log(- ItemId: {failureData . itemId}); }) orderProcessor . on('PROCESSINGSUCCESS', (orderNumber) => { console . log(Pre Order Checks Passed for {orderNumber}) }) orderProcessor . placeOrder({ orderNumber: 'OD2323', lineItems: [ { itemId: 3, quantity: 4 }, { itemId: 5, quantity: 4 } ] });\n\nFramework: Next.js\nTask Type: Full Stack Development\nDifficulty: hard\n\nRequirements:\n1.

On button click , the count value is incremented by one , and if it reaches the value cycle , it is reset to 0 instead . The demo above shows a simple example when the given cycle value is 4. In other words , if the text content of <button> before the click was integer k , then it is updated to k + 1, unless k + 1 = cycle , in which case it is reset to 0 instead . The following data-test-id attributes are required in the component for the tests to pass: The button rendering the current count value should have the data-test-id attribute 'cycle-counter'.

    "prompt": "Your company wants to create a new routing framework based on ExpressJS that allows developers to perform file-based routing . A new route can be simply added to the app by creating a new file in the pages folder . The framework reads the pages directory and generates a set of dynamic routes that can be added to Express routing . Consider the pages directory with the following files: - pages -- index . html -- product --- index . html --- slug . html --- product1. html The corresponding generated Express routes should be: Method Route Served File GET / /pages/index . html GET /product/product1 /pages/product/product1. html GET /product/:slug /pages/product/slug . html GET /product /pages/product/index . html Each sub-directory in the pages directory becomes a separate path in the dynamically generated URL . So the product subdirectory generates the route /product . The index . html file of each directory becomes the base HTML file for the route . To generate a route with URL parameters , create the file prefixed with an underscore , like so: /pages/product/slug . html -> product/:slug The module resolver . js is responsible for converting the file structure to the corresponding URL routes . The module should return a Promise as the default export . The Promise should resolve with an array of routes in the following format: [ { \"\"url\"\": \"\"/\"\", \"\"file\"\": \"\"/index . html\"\" }, { \"\"url\"\": \"\"/product\"\", \"\"file\"\": \"\"/product/index . html\"\" }, { \"\"url\"\": \"\"/product/:slug\"\", \"\"file\"\": \"\"/product/slug . html\"\" } ] The program must read the directory pages and generate the URLs . Note that you have to traverseand fetch details only for the immediate children of the pages directory(i . e ., fetch details of files only 1 level deep). Examples Let's say this is the directory structure: - pages -- index . html -- articles --- index . html The module resolver . js should generate the following routes array: [ { \"\"url\"\": \"\"/\"\", \"\"file\"\": \"\"/index . html\"\" }, { \"\"url\"\": \"\"/articles\"\", \"\"file\"\": \"\"/articles/index . html\"\" } ] Let's say this is the directory structure: - pages -- index . html -- articles --- index . html --- name . html --- name . html -- pictures --- id . html The module resolver . js should generate the following routes array: [ { \"\"url\"\": \"\"/\"\", \"\"file\"\": \"\"/index . html\"\" }, { \"\"url\"\": \"\"/articles\"\", \"\"file\"\": \"\"/articles/index . html\"\" }, { \"\"url\"\": \"\"/articles/name\"\", \"\"file\"\": \"\"/articles/name . html\"\" }, { \"\"url\"\": \"\"/articles/:name\"\", \"\"file\"\": \"\"/articles/name . html\"\" }, { \"\"url\"\": \"\"/pictures/:id\"\", \"\"file\"\": \"\"/pictures/id . html\"\" } ]\n\nFramework: Next.js\nTask Type: Full Stack Development\nDifficulty: hard\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Each input set has the following: An input field to type the number which has a label defining unit of measurement selected . A dropdown that has 3 options - Kilometre , Metre , Centimetre . Thearray containing the objects of all possible values in the dropdown is below . Use the 'id' property of each object to pass the value to each option as that is used for testing . [ { id: 0, label: 'Kilometre', unit: 'km' }, { id: 1, label: 'Metre', unit: 'm' }, { id: 2, label: 'Centimetre', unit: 'cm' } ] Initially , both the input fields are empty . The first dropdown should have 'Kilometre' selected on app load and the second dropdown should have 'Metre' selected on app load . Therefore , first input should have the label as 'km' and second inputshould have the label as 'm'. As and when a value is typed in either input field , convert it to unit selected in the other input set and update the value of other input field . Please note , when input fields have values , changing unit from dropdown should update the value of respective input field . Example - first dropdown has Kilometres selected and second dropdown has Metres selected . Any value in typed in first input field should render the converted Metre value in second input field . Use the following conversions: 1 Kilometre = 1000 Metres 1 Metre = 100 Centimetres The following data-test-id attributes are required in the component for the tests to pass: In the first input set - Input fieldhas data-test-id attribute 'app-input1'. Label hasdata-test-id attribute 'app-label1'. Select hasdata-test-id attribute 'app-select1'. In the second input set - Input field has data-test-id attribute 'app-input2'. Label hasdata-test-id attribute 'app-label2'. Select hasdata-test-id attribute 'app-select2'.

    "prompt": "In this challenge , your task is to implement a simple REST API to manage a collection of products . Each product is a JSON entry with the following keys: id : The unique product ID . (Integer) name : The name of the product . (String) price : The selling price of the product .(Float) mrp : The maximum retail price of the product . (Float) stock : The total quantity of the product available . (Integer) isPublished : The boolean value representing if the product is published or not . (Boolean) Here is an example of a product JSON object: { \"\"id\"\":1, \"\"name\"\": \"\"Premium Roast Coffee\"\", \"\"price\"\": 1.19, \"\"mrp\"\": 1.19, \"\"stock\"\": 1, \"\"isPublished\"\": false } The model implementation is provided and read-only . The task is to implement the REST service that exposes the /products endpoint , which allows for managing the collection of product records in the following way: POST request to /products : creates a new product expects a JSON product object without the id and isPublished propertyas thebody payload . You can assume that the given object is always valid . a new product should always be created withisPublished property set to false if the payload contains isPublished (either true or false) property , it should be disregarded and always set to false on object creation adds the given product object to the collection of products and assigns a unique integer id to it . The first created product must have id 1, the second one 2, and so on . the response code is 201, and the response body is the created product object GET request to /products : return a collection of all products the response code is 200, and the response body is an array of all product objects ordered by their ids in increasing order PATCH request to /products/<id> : you can assume that the body sent to this patch request will always be{\"\"isPublished\"\" : true} if the matching product exists , it should validate if the product can be published based on the following criteria in the same order they are mentioned below: CRITERIA 1:check if the mrp property of the matching product is greater than equal to the selling price of the product CRITERIA 2: check if the stock quantity of the product is greater than 0. if anyof the criterias fail , the response code is 422 with the response body containing an array of error messages: if only CRITERIA 1 fails , the response bodyshould be an array containing the message ' MRP should be less than equal to the Price' at the 0thindex . if only CRITERIA 2 fails , the response bodyshould be an array containing the message ' Stock count is 0' at the 0th index . if both CRITERIA 1 and CRITERIA 2 fail , the response body should be an array containing the messages ' MRP should be less than equal to the Price' at the 0th index , and the message ' Stock count is 0' at the 1stindex . if all the criterias pass , the matching product's isPublished field is be set to true and the response code is 204 with no response body . you can assume that the ID passed to the request will always be valid DELETE , PUT request to /products/<id> : the response code is 405 because the API does not allow deletingor modifying products for any id value You should complete the given project so that it passes all the test cases when running the provided unit tests . The project by default supports the use of the SQLite3 database . Example requests and responses POST request to /products Request body: { \"\"name\"\": \"\"Hash Browns\"\", \"\"price\"\": 1.19, \"\"mrp\"\": 1.19, \"\"stock\"\": 0, \"\"isPublished\"\": true } The response code is 201, and when converted to JSON , the response body is: { \"\"id\"\": 1, \"\"name\"\": \"\"Hash Browns\"\", \"\"price\"\": 1.19, \"\"mrp\"\": 1.19, \"\"stock\"\": 0, \"\"isPublished\"\": false } This adds a new object to the collection with the given properties and id 1. GET request to /products The response code is 200, and when converted to JSON , the response body (assuming that the below objects are all objects in the collection) is as follows: [ { \"\"id\"\": 1, \"\"name\"\": \"\"Hash Browns\"\", \"\"price\"\": 1.19, \"\"mrp\"\": 1.19, \"\"stock\"\": 0, \"\"isPublished\"\": false }, { \"\"id\"\": 2, \"\"name\"\": \"\"Egg Meal\"\", \"\"price\"\": 5.29, \"\"mrp\"\": 4.29, \"\"stock\"\": 1, \"\"isPublished\"\": false } ] PATCH request to /products/1 Request body: { \"\"isPublished\"\" : true} Product Object: { \"\"name\"\": \"\"Hash Browns\"\", \"\"price\"\": 1.19, \"\"mrp\"\": 1.19, \"\"stock\"\": 0, \"\"isPublished\"\": false } The response code is 422, as only the check for stock quantity fails . Response body: [\"\"Stock count is 0\"\"] PATCH request to /products/1 Request body: { \"\"isPublished\"\" : true} Product Object: { \"\"name\"\": \"\"Hash Browns\"\", \"\"price\"\": 2.19, \"\"mrp\"\": 1.19, \"\"stock\"\": 1, \"\"isPublished\"\": false } The response code is 422, as the MRP is less than the price . Response body: [\"\"MRP should be less than equal to the Price\"\"] PATCH request to /products/1 Request body: { \"\"isPublished\"\" : true} Product Object: { \"\"name\"\": \"\"Hash Browns\"\", \"\"price\"\": 2.19, \"\"mrp\"\": 1.19, \"\"stock\"\": 0, \"\"isPublished\"\": false } The response code is 422, as both the MRP is less than the price and the stock quantity is 0. Response body: [\"\"MRP should be less than equal to the Price\"\", \"\"Stock count is 0\"\"] PATCH request to /products/1 Request body: { \"\"isPublished\"\" : true} Product Object: { \"\"name\"\": \"\"Hash Browns\"\", \"\"price\"\": 1.19, \"\"mrp\"\": 1.19, \"\"stock\"\": 1, \"\"isPublished\"\": false } The response code is 204, as all the checks pass . There is no requirement for the response body . DELETE request to /products/1 The response code is 405 and there are no particular requirements for the response body .

    "prompt": "In this challenge , your task is to implement a simple REST API to manage a collection of the high-volume event streams . Each event is a JSON entry with the following keys: id : The unique entry ID . (Integer) eventType : The type of event data entry . Can be one of 'click' or 'pageView'. (String) user : The unique user ID .(Integer) date : The date when the event occurred(Date) Here is an example of an event JSON object: { \"\"id\"\": 1, \"\"eventType\"\": \"\"click\"\", \"\"user\"\": 1, \"\"date\"\": \"\"2020-08-29T08:48:48.737Z\"\" } The model implementation is provided and read-only . The task is to implement the REST service that exposes the /analytics endpoint , which allows for ingesting and querying the collection of event records in the following way: POST request to /analytics : creates a set of events serially expects a JSON array containing a series of user eventswithout the id and the date properties as thebody payload . Each object in the JSON array must be validated before saving based on the below-mentioned criteria . each list of the events can contain duplicate entries for auser and the event type . Every event objectin the listshould fulfilthe following criteriain order to be saved into the systemto avoid duplicates: a user can have only one 'click' event type in a 3-second window . All other 'click' events for the same user in the window should be discarded . a user can have only one 'pageView' event type in a 5-secondwindow . All other 'pageView' events for the same user in the window should be discarded . adds the given event object to the collection of events and assigns a unique integer id to it . The first created event must have id as 1, the second one has id as 2, and so on . adds the date property equal to the current system date to each saved object . the response code is 201, and the response body is a JSON containing the total number of events that were successfully ingested . Sample is : {\"\"ingested\"\" : 4} HINT: In order to find an event in a n-second window from current time T , you can use the [Op . gte] operator of sequelize with the value set to the (T-n) seconds . { date: { [Op . gte] : VALUE} } //Where value is T - n seconds NOTE: A utility function subtractSecondsFromCurrentTime is provided in the utils . js file which accepts the seconds to subtract from the current time and returns the javascript date object for the time (T-n) GET request to /analytics : return a collection of all events the response code is 200, and the response body is an array of all events in any sort order DELETE , PUT , PATCH request to /analytics/<id> : the response code is 405 because the API does not allow deletingor modifying events for any id value You should complete the given project so that it passes all the test cases when running the provided unit tests . The project by default supports the use of the SQLite3 database . Example requests and responses POST request to /analytics Request body: [ { \"\"user\"\": 1, \"\"eventType\"\": \"\"click\"\" }, { \"\"user\"\": 2, \"\"eventType\"\": \"\"click\"\" }, { \"\"user\"\": 1, \"\"eventType\"\": \"\"pageView\"\" } ] Notice that all the 3 entries in this event set have unique eventType-user mapping initially and there are no events in the system yet . Thus , all 3 can be saved . The response code is 201, and when converted to JSON , the response body is: {\"\"ingested\"\" : 3} This adds 3 new objects to the collection with the given properties and id 1,2,3 respectively and appropriate date values (set to the current system date). POST request to /analytics Request body: [ { \"\"user\"\": 1, \"\"eventType\"\": \"\"click\"\" }, { \"\"user\"\": 2, \"\"eventType\"\": \"\"pageView\"\" }, { \"\"user\"\": 1, \"\"eventType\"\": \"\"pageView\"\" } ] Before 3 seconds have passed after the first request: Each object can be evaluated as follows: 1. user: 1, eventType: click - An entry already exists for this combo in the system in the last 3 seconds . This can be discarded . 2. user: 2, eventType: pageView - No entries can be found for this combo saved in the last 5 seconds . This can be saved . 3. user: 1, eventType: pageView - An entry already exists for this combo saved in the last 3 seconds . This can be discarded . Only one object in this set matches the criteria and can be saved . The response code is 201 with the response body as: {\"\"ingested\"\" : 1} After 3 seconds have passed after the first request: Each object can be evaluated as follows: 1. user: 1, eventType: click - No entries can be found for this combo saved in the last 3 seconds . This can be saved . 2. user: 2, eventType: pageView - No entries can be found for this combo saved in the last 5 seconds . This can be saved . 3. user: 1, eventType: pageView - No entries can be found for this combo saved in the last 3 seconds . This can be saved . After 3 seconds have elapsed since the first request , all the objects in this set match the criteria and can be saved . The response code is 201 with the body: Response body: {\"\"ingested\"\" : 3} GET request to /analytics The response code is 200, and when converted to JSON , the response body (assuming that the below objects are all objects in the collection) is as follows: [ { \"\"id\"\": 1, \"\"eventType\"\": \"\"click\"\", \"\"user\"\": 1, \"\"date\"\": \"\"2020-08-29T09:46:12.638Z\"\" }, { \"\"id\"\": 2, \"\"eventType\"\": \"\"click\"\", \"\"user\"\": 2, \"\"date\"\": \"\"2020-08-29T09:46:12.644Z\"\" }, { \"\"id\"\": 3, \"\"eventType\"\": \"\"pageView\"\", \"\"user\"\": 1, \"\"date\"\": \"\"2020-08-29T09:46:12.647Z\"\" } ] DELETE request to /analytics/1 The response code is 405 and there are no particular requirements for the response body . PUT request to /analytics/1 The response code is 405 and there are no particular requirements for the response body . PATCH request to /analytics/1 The response code is 405 and there are no particular requirements for the response body .\n\nFramework: Next.js\nTask Type: Full Stack Development\nDifficulty: hard\n\nRequirements:\n1.

    "prompt": "As a NodeJS developer in your company , you have been given the responsibility to create a medical records manager module that fetches the records from an external API and uses these records to provide insights within the time limits specified . Implement the module records . js such that it has the following set of functionalities: The file should export a class MedicalRecords as the default export of the module , and it should inherit from the EventEmitter class . The class should have the following methods: constructor : Fetches the records from an API and getsthe list of paginated medical records . TheURL is ' https://jsonmock . hackerrank . com/api/medicalrecords ? page=[PAGE]' where PAGE is the numeric page number to fetch the paginated data from the API . When all the records are fetched from the API for all the pages , the class should emit the 'INITIALISED' event with no data requirements for the payload to be passed to the callback . The date from the API contains a list of medical records which are then used to provide insights . The responsehas the following format: { page: 1, perpage: 10, total: 1, totalpages: 1, data: [ // Data contains the list of medical records { id: 11, timestamp: 1563846626267, diagnosis: { id: 2, name: \"\"Common Cold\"\", severity: 1 }, vitals: { bloodPressureDiastole: 126, bloodPressureSystole: 75, pulse: 99, breathingRate: 22, bodyTemperature: 101.9 }, doctor: { id: 2, name: \"\"Dr Arnold Bullock\"\" }, userId: 3, userName: \"\"Helena Fernandez\"\", userDob: \"\"23-12-1987\"\", meta: { height: 157, weight: 108 } ... }, ] } page : The current page number of the response (Number) perpage : The total number of items in a single page . This property is immutable . (Number) total : The total number of medicalrecords matching the filter criteria (Number) totalpages : The total number of pages containing the results for the filter criteria(Number) data : The Array containing a list of records (Array of objects) getAveragePulseForUser : Accepts a numeric userId as an argument and returns the average pulse for the user as a float value synchronously . From the fetched records , use matching userId property to get the records for a particular user and useproperty 'vitals . pulse' for each record to calculate the avergae . getDiagnosedDiseaseNamesForDoctor : Accepts a numeric doctor ID as an argument and returns the unique disease names , synchronously , diagnosed by the doctor as a string separated by ',' in the order , they appear in the records . Use matching doctor . id to get the records for a particular doctor and use property 'diagnosis . name' property to calculate unique diseases . The file index . js is present with an example implementation of this class and can be used to validate if the class works as expected . The Example output of this file is mentioned below . Pages of the paginated APIs can be accessed by modifying the page value in the request . Eg: https://jsonmock . hackerrank . com/api/medicalrecords ? page=2 to fetch record for page number 2. You should complete the given project so that it passes all the test cases when running the provided unit tests . You are free to use any package make API requests . For convenience , the project already includes the axios package to make API calls . Test Requirements The records . js file should export the class MedicalRecords as the default export of the module . Make sure that the args passed to the getAveragePulseForUser and getDiagnosedDiseaseNamesForDoctor methods are Number only , between 1 to 4. The maximum time allotted to run each test is 5000ms . Example Implementation const MedicalRecords = require('./records'); const recordsManager = new MedicalRecords(); recordsManager . on('INITIALISED', () => { const averagePulse = recordsManager . getAveragePulseForUser(2) console . log(Average pulse is {averagePulse} for user (ID: {2})) const diseaseNames = recordsManager . getDiagnosedDiseaseNamesForDoctor(4) console . log(Diagnosed disease names of doctor ID: {4} , diseaseNames) })\n\nFramework: Next.js\nTask Type: Full Stack Development\nDifficulty: hard\n\nRequirements:\n1.

    "prompt": "Your company is launching a task manager app soon . The team has already created an ExpressJS app with several routes for creating and managing tasks . As the NodeJS developer in your company , you are required to write an Authorization middleware to provide access to some routes based on the role of the user . The middleware should implement the following functionalities: Complete the middleware . js module . The module's default export is an Express JS middleware function . This function should parse the 'x-role' header and check whether the role has access to the route or not . The scope of the route is passed to the middleware as a string in the format <SCOPENAME>.<ACTIONNAME> Example: To check if the user has access to the create a task (in the tasks route), the scope passed to the middleware will be \"\"tasks . create\"\", where \"\"tasks\"\" is the scope name and \"\"create\"\" is the action name separated by a \"\".\"\" dot . The roles-scopes mapping is stored in a file named roles . txt. The data is stored as a JSON string . The structure of each role-scope mapping object is as follows: { \"\"role\"\": \"\"admin\"\", \"\"scopes\"\": { \"\"tasks\"\": [ \"\"create\"\", \"\"getById\"\" ] } } role: This is the property which has to match with the x-role header value passed with the request . [STRING] scopes: An object containing key-value pairs corresponding to each SCOPENAME of the system . If the passed scope name does not match with any of the keys defined in the object , the access is invalid and the server should respondback with the status code 403 while not passing the control to the next function . [OBJECT] [scopeName]: Each dynamic key in the scopes object is a list of valid actions the user has access to in the current scope . [STRING ARRAY] If the role passed in the x-role header is not present in the roles JSON , it does not have access and the server should respondback with the status code 403 while not passing the control to the next function . If the role has access to the route , pass the control to the next function in the middleware stack . Complete the tasks . js module to include all the routes with the appropriate middleware mapping mentioned below . HINT: Make sure to trim the extra whitespaces from the JSON string before parsing it . Test Requirements The middleware functionshould be written in the file middleware . js , and the function should be the default export of the file . The function must call the next() function once authorization is successful . Routes Route Method Scope Admin Customer /tasks GET NA Allowed Allowed /tasks POST tasks . create Allowed Not Allowed /tasks/:id GET tasks . getById Allowed Allowed / GET NA Allowed Allowed\n\nFramework: Next.js\nTask Type: Full Stack Development\nDifficulty: hard\n\nRequirements:\n1.

    "prompt": "In this challenge , your task is to implement a simple REST API to manage a collection of reminders . Each product is a JSON entry with the following keys: id : The unique reminder ID . (Integer) user : The unique user ID . (Integer) description : The description of the reminder(String) date : The date of the reminder . Stored in UTC .(String) Here is an example of a reminder JSON object: { \"\"id\"\": 2, \"\"user\"\": 1, \"\"description\"\": \"\"Drink Coffee\"\", \"\"date\"\": \"\"2020-08-24T07:28:24.000Z\"\" } The model implementation is provided and read-only . The task is to implement the REST service that exposes the /reminders endpoint , which allows for managing the collection of reminder records in the following way: POST request to /reminders : creates a new reminder expects a JSON reminder object without the id propertyas thebody payload . You can assume that the given object is always valid . adds the given reminderobject to the collection of reminders and assigns a unique integer id to it . The first created reminder must have id 1, the second one 2, and so on . the response code is 201, and the response body is the created reminder object GET request to /reminders : return a collection of all reminders the response code is 200, and the response body is an array of all reminders objects ordered by their ids in increasing order optionally accepts query parameters user and after , for example /reminders ? user=1&after=1598448504000 . All these parameters are optional . In case they are present , only objects matching the parameters must be returned . The query param after accepts the time in milliseconds(Epoch) and can be used to find all the reminders that have the date property value after the queried time . HINT: Query for date in Sequelize can be done using the Op . gte operator . It accepts the date as an epoch integer , JS Date object or ISODate String . { date: { [Op . gte] : VALUE} } //Where VALUE can be one of the above mentioned types GET request to /reminders/<id> : returns a reminder with the given id if the matching reminder exists , the response code is 200 and the response body is the matching reminder object if there is no reminder with the given id in the collection , the response code is 404with the response body having the text ID not found. DELETE , PUT , PATCH request to /reminders/<id> : the response code is 405 because the API does not allow deletingor modifying reminders for any id value You should complete the given project so that it passes all the test cases when running the provided unit tests . The project by default supports the use of the SQLite3 database . Example requests and responses POST request to / reminders Request body: { \"\"user\"\": 1, \"\"description\"\": \"\"Eat Lunch\"\", \"\"date\"\": \"\"2020-08-24T13:28:24.000Z\"\" } The response code is 201, and when converted to JSON , the response body is: { \"\"id\"\": 1, \"\"user\"\": 1, \"\"description\"\": \"\"Eat Lunch\"\", \"\"date\"\": \"\"2020-08-24T13:28:24.000Z\"\" } This adds a new object to the collection with the given properties and id 1. GET request to /reminders The response code is 200, and when converted to JSON , the response body (assuming that the below objects are all objects in the collection) is as follows: [ { \"\"id\"\": 1, \"\"description\"\": \"\"Eat Lunch\"\", \"\"date\"\": \"\"2020-08-24T13:28:24.000Z\"\", \"\"user\"\": 1 }, { \"\"id\"\": 2, \"\"description\"\": \"\"Eat Breakfast\"\", \"\"date\"\": \"\"2020-08-25T08:28:24.000Z\"\", \"\"user\"\": 2 } ] GET request to /reminders ? after=1598341224000 The response code is 200, and when converted to JSON , the response body (assuming that the below objects are all objects matching the filter) is as follows: [ { \"\"id\"\": 2, \"\"description\"\": \"\"Eat Breakfast\"\", \"\"date\"\": \"\"2020-08-25T08:28:24.000Z\"\", \"\"user\"\": 2 } ] GET request to /reminders ? user=2 The response code is 200, and when converted to JSON , the response body (assuming that the below objects are all objects matching the filter) is as follows: [ { \"\"id\"\": 2, \"\"description\"\": \"\"Eat Breakfast\"\", \"\"date\"\": \"\"2020-08-25T08:28:24.000Z\"\", \"\"user\"\": 2 } ] GET request to /reminders/2 The response code is 200, and when converted to JSON , the response body (assuming that the object with id as 2 exists) is as follows: { \"\"id\"\": 2, \"\"description\"\": \"\"Eat Breakfast\"\", \"\"date\"\": \"\"2020-08-25T08:28:24.000Z\"\", \"\"user\"\": 2 } If an object with id 2 doesn't exist , then the response code is 404 with the response body having the text ID not found. DELETE request to /reminders/1 The response code is 405 and there are no particular requirements for the response body .

    "prompt": "In this challenge , your task is to implement an ExpressJS based API Aggregator service . The goal to communicate with various APIs , accumulate the responses and return a consolidated transformed response . The app accepts a single request to the endpoint /users/:userName . The response to be returned should be fetched from 2 different API sources detailed as follows: 1. User Details The user details should be fetched from the API https://jsonmock . hackerrank . com/api/articleusers ? username=<USERNAME> where <USERNAME> is the parameter passed to the request . The response from the external API is a JSON object having the following structure: { page: 1, perpage: 10, total: 1, totalpages: 1, data: [ // Data contains the list of users matching the username . If the data for the username is present , the array will contain only one object . { \"\"id\"\": 1, \"\"username\"\": \"\"epaga\"\", ... } ] } If the username passed to the request does not exist in the external system , the data array will be empty . In such a scenario , the local API should respond with a status code of 404 with the response body having the text as \"\"Username Not Found\"\". 2. User Transactions If the user details is successfully fetched from the First API , use the ID property of the details object(received in above API call) to fetch the paginated transactions for the user . The API to fetch the list of paginated transactions is https://jsonmock . hackerrank . com/api/transactions ? page=<PAGE>&userId=<USERID> where <PAGE> is the numeric page number to fetch the paginated data from the API and the <USERID> should match with the ID property fetched from the First API . The response from the transactions API has the following format: { page: 1, perpage: 10, total: 1, totalpages: 1, data: [ // Data contains the list of user transaction matching the user ID . { \"\"id\"\": 8, \"\"userId\"\": 4, \"\"userName\"\": \"\"Francesco De Mello\"\", \"\"timestamp\"\": 1548805761859, \"\"txnType\"\": \"\"credit\"\", \"\"amount\"\": \"\"1,214.44\"\", ... } ] } The response structure from the second API can be described as follows: page : The current page number of the response (Number) perpage : The total number of items in a single page . This property is immutable . (Number) total : The total number of transactions matching the filter criteria (Number) totalpages : The total number of pages containing the results for the filter criteria(Number) data : The Array containing a list of transactions matching the filter criteria (Array of objects) Further pages of the paginated APIs can be accessed by modifying the page value in the request . Eg: https://jsonmock . hackerrank . com/api/transactions ? page=2&userId=<USERID> Using the responses from both the API sources , a new transformed response has to be constructed and returned back in the response body . Here is an example of the final response object: { \"\"user\"\": { \"\"id\"\": 6, \"\"username\"\": \"\"saintamh\"\", \"\"about\"\": \"\"\"\", \"\"submitted\"\": 71, \"\"updatedat\"\": \"\"2019-09-06T11:13:29.000Z\"\", \"\"submissioncount\"\": 51, \"\"commentcount\"\": 15, \"\"createdat\"\": 1510174513 }, \"\"totalTransactions\"\": 67, \"\"summary\"\": [ { \"\"id\"\": 8, \"\"userId\"\": 6, \"\"userName\"\": \"\"Francesco De Mello\"\", \"\"timestamp\"\": 1548805761859, \"\"txnType\"\": \"\"credit\"\", \"\"amount\"\": \"\"1,214.44\"\", \"\"location\"\": { \"\"id\"\": 1, \"\"address\"\": \"\"948, Entroflex , Franklin Avenue\"\", \"\"city\"\": \"\"Ilchester\"\", \"\"zipCode\"\": 84181 }, \"\"ip\"\": \"\"35.151.1.82\"\" } ] } The response structure can be described as follows: user : The user details object fetched from the first API source(User) totalTransactions : The overall number of transactions for the user fetched from the second API(Number) summary : Only the first 3 transactions for the user fetched from the second API . Should be a blank array if there are no transactions for the user(Transactions Array) The task is to implement the REST service that exposes the /users/:userName endpoint . You should complete the given project so that it passes all the test cases when running the provided unit tests . The project includes the following npm packages pre-installed through npm . You are free to use any package to help with the API requests . 1. Axios 2. Request 3. Node Fetch 4. Bluebird Example requests and responses GET request to /users/epaga The response code is 200, and when converted to JSON , the response body is: { \"\"user\"\": { \"\"id\"\": 1, \"\"username\"\": \"\"epaga\"\", \"\"about\"\": \"\"Java developer / team leader at inetsoftware . de by day<p>iOS developer by night<p>http://www . mindscopeapp . com<p>http://inflightassistant . info<p>http://appstore . com/johngoering<p>[ my public key: https://keybase . io/johngoering; my proof: https://keybase . io/johngoering/sigs/I1UIk7t3PjfB5v2GI-fhiOMvdkzn370Z2iU5GitXa0 ]<p>hnchat:oYwa7PJ4Yaf1Vw9Om4ju\"\", \"\"submitted\"\": 654, \"\"updatedat\"\": \"\"2019-08-29T13:45:12.000Z\"\", \"\"submissioncount\"\": 197, \"\"commentcount\"\": 439, \"\"createdat\"\": 1301039509 }, \"\"totalTransactions\"\": 79, \"\"summary\"\": [ { \"\"id\"\": 1, \"\"userId\"\": 1, \"\"userName\"\": \"\"John Oliver\"\", \"\"timestamp\"\": 1549536882071, \"\"txnType\"\": \"\"debit\"\", \"\"amount\"\": \"\"1,670.57\"\", \"\"location\"\": { \"\"id\"\": 7, \"\"address\"\": \"\"770, Deepends , Stockton Street\"\", \"\"city\"\": \"\"Ripley\"\", \"\"zipCode\"\": 44139 }, \"\"ip\"\": \"\"212.215.115.165\"\" }, ... ] } GET request to /users/replicatorblog The response code is 200, and when converted to JSON , the response body is: { \"\"user\"\": { \"\"id\"\": 8, \"\"username\"\": \"\"replicatorblog\"\", \"\"about\"\": \"\"https://twitter . com/josephflaherty<p>Formerly Wired:<p>https://www . wired . com/author/joseph-flaherty/<p>Now covering startups for Founder Collective , a fantastic VC firm:<p>http://www . foundercollective . com/\"\", \"\"submitted\"\": 1441, \"\"updatedat\"\": \"\"2019-09-06T02:06:35.000Z\"\", \"\"submissioncount\"\": 550, \"\"commentcount\"\": 790, \"\"createdat\"\": 1224455310 }, \"\"totalTransactions\"\": 0, \"\"summary\"\": [] } GET request to /users/alliam The response code is 404, as no such user exists and the response body is the string \"\"Username Not Found\"\".\n\nFramework: Next.js\nTask Type: Full Stack Development\nDifficulty: hard\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Implement the module parking . js such that the application has following set of functionalities: The file should export a class Parking as the default export of the module , and it should inherit from the EventEmitter class . The constructor of the classinitialises thenumber of slots available which defaults to 5. Itoptionally accepts a parameter , anumber , and assigns number of slots using this value if itis passed . The constructor should initialise a list of size equivalent to the number of slots available , and if a car is not assigned to aslot at any point in time , the correspondingslot should have a null value in the list . The class should have the following methods: parkCar : Accepts an object having the property carNumber as a parameterand assigns this car to the first empty slot available . If no slots are available for parking , the class should emit a 'parkingfull' event , with an object having the property carNumber havingvalue same as the carNumber from parameter , sent as the payload to the callback function . Else , if the parking operation was successful , the class should emit a 'parkingstarted' event , with an object having the property carNumber havingvalue same as the carNumber from parameter , sent as the payload to the callback function Parameter to this function has following structure: { carNumber : 'CAR-3' (String or Number) } getList : Returns the current state of the slots . If a slot is not occupied , the corresponding index in the array should have a null value , else it should contain the car number of the vehicle . remove : Accepts a single parameter carNumber (string or number). If the vehicle having the same carNumber is parked in one of the slots , removes its assignment from the list and reallocatenull value to the slot which just became empty . If the car is removed from the parking , the class should emit a 'parkingremoved' event , with an object having the property carNumber havingvalue same as the carNumber from parameter , sent as the payload to the callback function . Else if , no matching cars are parked with the carNumber passed , the class should emit a 'invalidnumber' event , with an object having the property carNumber havingvalue same as the carNumber from parameter , sent as the payload to the callback function NOTE: You can assume that the carNumber passed to the parkCar function is always unique and you do not have handle this scenario . The file index . js is present with an example implementation of this class that can be used to validate if the class works as expected . The Example output of this file is mentioned below . Test Requirements The parking . js file should export the class Parking as the default export of the module . Make sure that the carNumber passed to the parkCar method is valid (Number , String). The default number of slots of the class should be 5. Test cases take care of emitting interval event with only positive numbers . So any kind of validation on numbers is not required . Example Output Parking Started: CAR - 10 Parking Started: CAR - 20 Parking Started: CAR - 30 Parked at slot 1: CAR - 10 Parked at slot 2: CAR - 20 Parked at slot 3: CAR - 30 Slot 4 is empty Slot 5 is empty Car number CAR - 20 removed from parking .

    "project_type": "nextjs",
    "prompt": "As the NodeJS developer in your company , you are required to write an ExpressJS Rate Limiting middleware to throttle the API traffic for the app to make sure that the app runs at full efficiency . The middleware should implement the following functionalities: Implement the rate-limiter . js middleware module . The module should export the class RateLimiter by default . This class must have a method named 'apply' which acts as the express middleware function . This class has 2 member variables , 'limit', and 'windowMs'. The significance of these members are described below: windowMs : The period of time in which an IP address can hit a particular number of requests (numeric window size in milliseconds). [Number] limit : The number of requests each IP address can hit in a period of time defined by the 'windowMs' parameter . The default value for limit property is 5 and the default value for windowMs is 1000 milliseconds . This translates to the Rate Limit of 5 request per second per IP address . Rate Limit Example: 20 requests per 5 seconds per IP Address | | limit windowMs (5000 milliseconds) The classoptionally accepts an object containing the properties , 'limit', and 'windowMs'. If it is present , use this object to assign the values to members ' windowMs' and 'limit'. (Or else use default values). This middleware should be initialized and the apply methods should be stacked to the GET '/tasks' route of the app to make sure that the number of requests to this route for a user by their IP address is within the limits specified . If the current request has crossed the limits specified , the server should return the response with the status code 429 with no particular requirement on the response body . In this case , the control should not be passed to the next function of the middleware . If the current request is valid and within the limits specified , a header 'x-limit-remaining' should be added to the response with the value as the number of requests remaining before the limit in the current window is reached . The control should be passed to the next function . For a particular IP address , when limit is reached in a window , for the request to go through again , difference between the current time and the time of thelast request that passed , should be greater than or equal to windowMs . The IP address for the request can be extracted from the 'req . ip' property of the request object passed to the middleware . For testing , the app has 'trust proxy' enabled and this the 'x-forwarded-for' header can be used to send a request using different IP addressed . The value of this header will be set as the 'req . ip' property of the request object . Note: Please make sure to properly set the context for the apply method which will be used as the middleware function . Test Requirements The middleware classshould be written in the file rate-limiter . js , and it should be the default export for the file . This class should have a method named apply which will be used as the middleware function . The function must call the next() function if the request is successful . Please use one of 'res . set' or 'res . setHeader' methods of the express to set the header in the response object . Please use the 'res . status' method chained with the 'send' method of the response object to return the response . res . status(STATUSCODE). send('YOURBODY'); Examples Let's look at some examples: Rate Limit: 4 Req/Sec Let's assume each request comes at 0.2 second intervals Window size: 1 second At 0.2 seconds , Req 1 ---------------------- IP : 192.168.0.1 Valid: No entry for this IP address exists yet and buffer is for 4 requests in 1 second . Response Header: x-limit-remaining = 3 As now only 3 more requests can be hit before the rate limit is reached At 0.4 seconds , Req 2 ---------------------- IP : 192.168.0.1 Valid: The entry for IP exists but its limit is 4 while this is only the 2nd request in this window . Response Header: x-limit-remaining = 2 At 0.6 seconds , Req 3 ---------------------- IP : 192.168.0.1 Valid: The entry for IP exists but its limit is 4 while this is only the 3rd request in this window . Response Header: x-limit-remaining = 1 At 0.8 seconds , Req 4 ---------------------- IP : 192.168.0.1 Valid: The entry for IP exists but its limit is 4 but this is the last request for this IP in this window . Response Header: x-limit-remaining = 0 At 1 seconds , Req 5 ---------------------- IP : 192.168.0.1 Invalid: The limit for this request has been reached . Response Status: 429 This IP address has to wait the equivalent of 1 unit of window size to get a valid response again . Thus the next valid request can only be sent for this IP 1 second later . At 1 seconds , Req 1 for different IP ---------------------- IP : 192.168.0.2 Valid: No entry for this IP address exists yet and buffer is for 4 requests in 1 second . Response Header: x-limit-remaining = 3\n\nFramework: Next.js\nTask Type: Full Stack Development\nDifficulty: hard\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It should allow for managing the collection of items in a Kanban Board in the current stage in the following way: POSTrequest to /boards : creates a new item in the board expects a JSON item object without the id and stage propertyas thebody payload . You can assume that the given object is always valid . adds the given object containing the item to the board and assigns a unique integer id to it . The first created item must have an id of 1, the second one , 2, and so on . Each newly created item should have a stage of 1. You can assume that the stage property will never be passed . The response code is 201, and the response body is the created kanban board item object . PUT request to /boards/:id accepts the stage property containing the new stage as the body payload updates the stage of the item for the passed item id If the stage value passed is not 1,2, or 3, return the status code 400 with no requirement on the response body . If the stage value is 1, 2 or 3, the response code is 200, with the updated item as the response body . You can assume that the passed item ID always exists .

PUT request to /boards/1 Request body: { \"\"stage\"\": 2 } The response code is 200, the stage of item 1 has been updated to 2, and the updated item object is sent in the response body: { \"\"id\"\": 1, \"\"stage\"\": 2, \"\"title\"\": \"\"Create a new project\"\" } PUT request to /boards/1 Request body: { \"\"stage\"\": 4 } The response code is 400 with no requirements for the response body .\n\nFramework: Next.js\nTask Type: Full Stack Development\nDifficulty: hard\n\nRequirements:\n1.
