Deduct 3 points for each low-quality or unrealistic icon, 5 points for poor layout of materials, and 5 points for confusing visual hierarchy. The full score is 10 points.",

Deduct 5 points for each operation without feedback, 3 points for animations that are too fast to observe properly, and 5 points for missing educational guidance during critical steps. The full score is 10 points."

Try to ensure that the code you generate is executable and can be demonstrated. I am a young teacher teaching second grade (second semester). I now want to develop a mental arithmetic mini-program for second grade (second semester). This mini-program mainly focuses on multiplication tables as its core, then includes some calculations with multiplication and division, as well as fill-in-the-blank exercises for multiplication tables. These could involve not knowing the first multiplicand and having to fill it in to calculate the product, or not knowing the product or multiplicand and having to fill it in. This mental arithmetic program needs to be under my control with certain buttons. These buttons should preferably be displayed in Chinese.",

      "Review whether the code accurately implements the complete multiplication tables (1-9) with proper display and interactions. Check if the program allows students to practice, review, and be tested on the tables. Score 0 if the core functionality is missing, 5 if only basic tables are shown without interaction, and 10 if all multiplication tables are fully interactive with proper learning progression.",
      "Evaluate whether the code includes different types of exercises: standard multiplication/division calculations, fill-in-the-blank for first multiplicand, fill-in-the-blank for second multiplicand, and fill-in-the-blank for the product. Check if the program generates appropriate difficulty levels for grade 2 students. Deduct 3 points for each missing exercise type. The full score is 10 points.",
      "Check whether the code provides a teacher control panel with proper Chinese-labeled buttons for adjusting difficulty levels, selecting exercise types, tracking student progress, and managing the program flow. The interface should give the teacher full control over the learning experience. Deduct 2 points for each missing essential function. The full score is 10 points.",
      "Assess whether the code implements immediate feedback for student answers, appropriate encouragement/correction messages, progress tracking, and a scoring system suitable for second-grade students. Check if visual/audio feedback is child-friendly and educational. Deduct 3 points if immediate feedback is missing, 3 points if the scoring system is not grade-appropriate, and 4 points if there's no progress tracking. The full score is 10 points.",
      "Evaluate whether the code can handle common abnormal situations (such as incorrect inputs, accidental button clicks, interruptions, etc.) and provide child-friendly error prompts or recovery mechanisms. Code with strong robustness should be able to effectively handle these edge cases, giving 10 points. If the robustness is average, give 5 points, and if no exceptions are handled, give 0 points.",
      "Check whether the code includes surprise features that enhance the learning experience (e.g., 1. Gamification elements like reward badges 2. Visual multiplication representations 3. Adaptive difficulty that adjusts to student performance). Add 3 points for each practical innovative feature implemented (maximum 10 points).",
      "Strictly check three types of redundancy: 1. Redundant implementation of similar functions (e.g., multiple ways to practice the same concept) 2. Function modules unrelated to math learning (e.g., unnecessary games) 3. Fancy effects that may distract young learners. Deduct 3 points for each redundancy found, and directly deduct 10 points if the core learning functions are interfered with by redundant code.",
      "Review modular design (such as separating UI/logic/data layers), code readability appropriate for educational software, and maintainability for teacher modifications. Deduct 5 points if global state pollution is found; deduct 5 points if the code duplication rate is too high (over 30%); deduct 5 points if the code structure would make it difficult for the teacher to make simple modifications. The full score is 10 points.",
      "Evaluate whether the overall design follows child-friendly principles: 1) Bright but not overwhelming colors 2) Clear, large buttons with Chinese labels 3) Age-appropriate fonts and sizes (≥16px) 4) Simple, uncluttered layout appropriate for 7-8 year olds. Deduct 3 points for each visually confusing element, 5 points for inappropriate color schemes, and 5 points for text that would be difficult for second-graders to read. The full score is 10 points.",
      "Judge whether the interactions are appropriate for 7-8 year old children: 1) Large, easy-to-tap buttons (at least 44×44px) 2) Forgiving interaction patterns that don't require precise movements 3) Clear visual/audio feedback for each action 4) Appropriate animation speed for children's cognitive abilities. Deduct 5 points for touch targets that are too small, 3 points for complex gestures, and 5 points for confusing navigation. The full score is 10 points."
